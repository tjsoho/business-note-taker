# BUsiness Note Taker

## Task

This assignment required me to modify some starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.


## User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```


## Mock-Up

The following images show the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Getting Started
When the user is on the home page, click the button in the center.
Once navigated to the note taker page, Click in the fields to enter text. Once a title has been entered and some list items are entered under the title, a save button on the top right appears.
Click this button to save your list. 
To create a new list click the plus button in the top right corner.
Click any of the lists on the left to show and alter any previous lists or simply click the delete button to delete the list.

## Further Development 
I would like to add a check box with each list item to enable the user to check off the item once the task has completed. 
When the check button is clicked, I would like to make the list item either strike through or opacity so it is obvious which notes have been completed

## Difficulties
I kept forgetting to run the server.js in the terminal. Multiple times I tried to open the index.html and notes.html to find the app not working.
